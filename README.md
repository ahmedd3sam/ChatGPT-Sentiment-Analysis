# ChatGPT-Sentiment-Analysis:
perform text classification using a machine learning classification model and word Embeddings.
ChatGPT has been a major talk in the tech world. There have been several tweets about ChatGPT where users post their opinions towards it. This dataset gathered 219293 tweets for a month, which classifies each tweet into three classes (i.e., positive “good”, negative “bad”, or neutral).

1- Apply the pre-processing steps which include “Tokenization, stemming, lemmatization to clean up and extract the valid final dataset from dataset, which will be used to train our model.\
2- Apply Glove word embeddings to be one of the pre-processing steps while preparing our dataset.\
3-  split dataset into 80 % - 20 %. The first 80 % will be used as training data for the classifier. While the other 20 % will be used as testing data for the model to be able to identify the “accuracy percentage”.\
4- Train 2 classification models to predict the label of the tweet.  (CNN, LSTM). each model train multiple times to optimize hyper parameters.\
